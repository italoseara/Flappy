### Mac/Linux (with bash + make)

git clone https://github.com/italoseara/Flappy
cd Flappy
make pip
make run
```

### Windows (with `make.bat`)

There's a `make.bat` script on this project that can simulate the
behavior of makefiles on windows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/italoseara/Flappy
cd Flappy

make run
```
